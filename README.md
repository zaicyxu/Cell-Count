# Cell-Count
This is a very mature project for pathological cell identification.

This project uses ppyolo training to obtain appropriate weights for identifying cells, uses NMS for cell identification, uses edge device NVIDIA NX as an embedded device, and uses Linux aarch64 as the development environment to construct a set of photo recognition, automatic focusing, and automatic recognition. , an integrated cell identification machine that automatically calculates and obtains analysis reports.

For the purpose of project protection, the model weight files, front-end and back-end interaction processes and codes will not be uploaded and are only used for communication and learning.
